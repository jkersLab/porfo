        <h3><u>FTP File Sync Script</u></h3>
        <p>Using powershell and scheduled tasks, created a script that checked FTP location every hour for new files, if there was, it would download the files down to a file share, and send an email to relevant recipients.</p>

        <h3><u>Real Time Chat Application</u></h3>
        <p>Created a real time chat application using Django and Redis. I did not have a lot of experience with Redis or Websockets, and this was a great exercise. Some features included: User registration/authentication , Chat room creation, profile picture selection.
        Chats are received and updated via websocket, as well as stored in a database as a historical message.

        <h3><u>Record Collection Website</u></h3>
        <p>Created a website where I could track Vinyl records in my collection. I used Django to create a database that I could upload record details to. I also integrated the Spotify API where you could play the selected album on the site. This was one of my first projects using Django.</p>

        <h3><u>Nascar Pool Website</u></h3>
        <p>Created a website where Family members could pick 10 drivers each week, I would then use available Nascar API's to pull standings after the race is done. Previous weeks were viewable, as well as leaderboards for user scores based on their picks.</p>
